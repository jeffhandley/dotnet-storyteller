# Configure the AI Model Provider
## Using OpenAI

To call the OpenAI REST API, you will need an API key. To obtain one, first [create a new OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) or [log in](https://platform.openai.com/login). Next, navigate to the API key page and select "Create new secret key", optionally naming the key. Make sure to save your API key somewhere safe and do not share it with anyone.

From the command line, configure your API key for this project using .NET User Secrets by running the following commands:

```sh
cd <<your-project-directory>>
dotnet user-secrets set OpenAI:Key YOUR-API-KEY
```
